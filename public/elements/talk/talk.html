                <p>Prof. Babbage will give a talk about his awesome achievements.</p>
                <p>After the attempt at making the first difference engine fell through, Babbage worked to design a more
                    complex machine called the Analytical Engine. He hired C. G. Jarvis, who had previously worked for
                    Clement as a draughtsman. The Analytical Engine marks the transition from mechanised arithmetic
                    to fully-fledged general purpose computation. It is largely on it that Babbage's standing as computer
                    pioneer rests.</p>
                <p>The major innovation was that the Analytical Engine was to be programmed using punched cards: the
                    Engine was intended to use loops of Jacquard's punched cards to control a mechanical calculator,
                    which could use as input the results of preceding computations. The machine was also intended
                    to employ several features subsequently used in modern computers, including sequential control,
                    branching and looping. It would have been the first mechanical device to be, in principle,
                    Turing-complete. The Engine was not a single physical machine, but rather a succession of designs
                    that Babbage tinkered with until his death in 1871.</p>
